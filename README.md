## Introduction
This is the first project in Udacity Data Analysis Professional Track using Python and Numpy &amp; pandas Libraries 

## Overview
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. code is written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also a I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
